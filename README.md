# MyTutor
SoftUni Angular Course Project

This application is a platform for viewing and creating adds for private tutoring.

The application has a persistent DB using Back4App as backend.

# Main Features
Any user (registered or not) can access the application and review the currently active adds for private tutors.

On the home page the user can see the latest three adds on the platform.

The user can access the Tutors section by clicking See Tutors and see all active adds.
The adds on the sytem can be filtered by Subject so that only desired adds are displayed.
If the user clears up the serach field and clicks outside of it, the whole list of adds is again displayed.

The user can review the tutor profile by clicking on View Profile.

The user has the option to register on the platform using email and password.
When the user is registered and logged into the platform with their credentials, they can access the tutor registration form.

By submitting the tutor registration form, the user is now listed on the app as private tutor and can be contacted by any user on the platform.

The user registered as tutor can access their own profile and edit the add they've submitted.
